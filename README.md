 # About This Project
 
Hi there, I am Rahul Gupta and I created this project out of curiosity and my intrests in the field of Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning.

This project is been created using [simple Neural Network js](https://github.com/RAHUL1115/simpleNeuralNetwork) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

## [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)

p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free and open-source because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.
